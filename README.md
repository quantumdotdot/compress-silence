 #ReaScript Name: Compress Silence

 Description: Shrinks silence between items in proportion to the silence's length. Functions similarly to Audacity's Truncate Silence feature. Currently reduces silences by 60%.

 Instructions: Select two items minimum on the same or different tracks. Currently, it will not shrink properly if there is overlap between items.
